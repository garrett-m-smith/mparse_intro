\opening{Dear Dr. Gibson,}

I would like to submit for your consideration the attached manuscript, entitled
\emph{Mparse: A new framework for self-organized, incremental sentence
comprehension}.

The paper presents a computational model of word-by-word sentence parsing,
called \emph{mparse}, in which syntactic structures for whole sentences
assemble themselves out of word-word dependency links. Self-organization as
theory of parsing goes back at least to Kempen and Vosse (1989;
\emph{Connection Science 1}(3)), but previous implementations have faced a
number of shortcomings. The new model seeks to alleviate these issues to
make self-organized parsing a more easily and broadly testable theory in
psycholinguistics. I test the model on garden path, local coherence, and
ambiguity advantage effects and find that it reproduces human reading time
behavior. I believe the manuscript will be of interest to the \emph{Open
Mind} readership as it provides a mathematically tractable implementation
of self-organization that makes novel experimental predictions and can form
the basis for future comparisons with other theories of sentence
processing.
